# quadtree-geolocation

Quadtree is a tree data structure that has 4 "children", each of these children have 4 more each one, and so on, until the specified granularity is achieved.

This structure is beautiful in so many ways, there's a lot of usages. The most common usages are:
*Optimization of rendering on games 
*Dynamic lighthing effect on games
*Geolocation
*Image compression
*A.I. Path fingind

For this example, we'll use the quadtree for optimizing Geolocation. Imagine that we have an app that shows the user other users around them, or pictures around them.

The traditional way would be comparing the distance between User A and B. Using latitude and longitude of both points, we could calculate the distance in degrees and then convert it to KMs or Miles. So far so good.

As we know, the formula to calculate the distance between two points is:

The problem starts here, SQRT functions are CPU expensive, imagine that our backend would need to do this for each request against all users on the database.

We could even add some filters to help, maybe compare only the same country, or city. Even so, it's not sustainable.
Fortunately, we can represent our planet in a 2D map, using latitude and longitude.

Longitude -180 to 180
Latitude -90 to 90

Great! Now we know that we can create a quadtree to represent the whole world. First we need to define the size of the deepest node/child, let's say the deepest node will have 1km * 1km.
